        <h1> why this blog ? </h1>
        <span>dated 18th feb 2025</span>

        <p>
            existential questions are always hard. they make us question our every actions and decisions.
            they make us consider other perspectives available and introspect ourselves in the face of uncertainty.
            yet (or hence) they offer clarity, towards the future and how to face it (or adjust to it).
        </p>

        <p>
            i too am in such a situation where i am bombarded with existential questions, including but not limited to
            career, social presence and creativity. the first and foremost of them is - why this blog ?
        </p>

        <p>
            there definitely are multiple answers (or multiple factors contributing to a single answer).
            
            <br>

            <em>first</em>: this domain name will expire, if i don't renew it this month and i desperately need reasons to
            keep it alive. although my domain name is used for email forwarding purposes, i wouldn't think the utility
            it provides is worth paying close to 30$ an year.

            <br>

            <em>second</em>: i want this blog to act as a showcase for all my projects, something akin to proof-of-work,
            wherein the people who are interested in my work (probably recruiters or interested people) can access them
            in an organised way.

            <br>

            <em>third</em>: i need social validation (or atleast a face on the internet). i, currently am not active on any
            social media platforms and hence my presence on internet is virtually invisible. i'd like this blog to be my
            face, to share the things i like, to curate things (articles, resources) and write about them

            <br>

            <em>fourth</em>: i'd like to pick up writing again. i left writing anything public after finsihing my school and haven't
            written anything worth reading (i am glad that i am writing this). i don't consider myself an expert in any fields, yet 
            and writing about the things i like and do would only open me up to others and make me feel more human

        </p>

        <p>
            there may be multiple other reasons, which aren't at the top my head right now. i just feel like expoloring both
            the technical and creative sides of myself, hence the need for documenting the actions. i am considering writing 
            technical articles, explaining hacks and curiousity fueled rabbit-holes, while also dabbling with literature (the
            term sounds too big and sophisticated for what i have in mind) by writing (or expressing) thoughts in the form that
            retains the essence while being up for multiple interpretations.
        </p>

        <p>
            i guess i'll end it here. too much polishing and seeking perfectionism ruins the game, which is to be taken as
            a part of ourselves, hence the imperfection.
        </p>
